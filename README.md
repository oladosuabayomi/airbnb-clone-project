- Strengthen understanding of **backend APIs and database design**.  
- Apply **best practices in web development, version control, and team collaboration**.  
- Deploy a fully working application to simulate real-world production.  

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React), Typescript, Next.js  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, Python (Django) (planned)  
- **Database:** MongoDB or PostgreSQL (planned)  
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub  
- **Design Tools:** Figma (UI/UX design)  
- **Deployment:** To be determined (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, or AWS)  

## UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals
The success of a booking platform depends heavily on its design. For this project, the following goals guide the UI/UX process:

- **Create an intuitive booking flow:** Ensure that users can easily search, view, and book properties without unnecessary steps or confusion.  
- **Maintain visual consistency:** Use a consistent color scheme, typography, and component patterns across the application.  
- **Ensure responsiveness:** Design with a **mobile-first approach** to guarantee seamless experiences on smartphones, tablets, and desktops.  
- **Prioritize accessibility:** Follow WCAG guidelines so the platform is inclusive and usable by people of different abilities.  
- **Optimize performance:** Keep the interface lightweight to reduce loading times and improve user satisfaction.  

### Key Features
The core features that shape the design include:  
- **Property search and filtering** for quick discovery of suitable listings.  
- **Detailed property viewing** with images, amenities, ratings, and host information.  
- **Secure checkout process** to complete bookings with confidence.  
- **User authentication system** for account creation, login, and personalized experiences.  

### Primary Pages
The application’s design revolves around three main pages. Each page is structured to deliver clarity, usability, and smooth navigation:  

| Page                  | Description                                                                                          |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Property Listing View** | Displays available properties in a grid layout. Includes filtering options (location, price, rating) and a search bar for easy discovery. |
| **Listing Detailed View** | Provides complete property details such as images, amenities, pricing, host details, and booking options. |
| **Simple Checkout View**  | Offers a streamlined process for users to confirm their booking and make secure payments. Keeps forms minimal and straightforward. |

### Importance of User-Friendly Design
A user-friendly design is critical in booking systems because:  
- **Reduces friction:** Users can quickly find what they’re looking for and proceed to booking without confusion.  
- **Increases conversions:** Clear navigation and intuitive flows encourage users to complete their bookings.  
- **Builds trust:** A polished, consistent, and accessible design helps users feel confident in the platform’s reliability.  
- **Improves accessibility:** Making the platform usable for people with disabilities expands the potential audience and complies with standards.  
- **Enhances satisfaction:** A smooth experience leads to positive impressions, repeat use, and recommendations.  

### Figma Design Specifications

As part of the design planning, we explored the Figma environment to identify key design properties. These properties form the foundation of a consistent, accessible, and user-friendly interface.

#### Color Styles
- **Primary:** `#34967C` (used for primary actions, highlights, and brand identity)  
- **Secondary:** `#FFA800` (used for accents, buttons, and call-to-action elements)  
- **Background:** `#FFFFFF` (clean base background for clarity and simplicity)  
- **Background Secondary:** `#161117` (used for footers, overlays, or darker sections)  
- **Text:** `#161117` (used for main body text and headings to ensure readability)  

#### Typography
- **Primary Font:** Quicksand  
- **Secondary Font:** Source Sans Pro  
- **Body Text:** Quicksand, Medium (500), `16px` (scales with `rem` for accessibility)  
- **Headings:** Quicksand, Bold (700), `clamp(24px, 2vw, 32px)` for responsiveness  
- **Secondary Text:** Source Sans Pro, Regular (400), `14px` (minimum, avoid going smaller on mobile)  

### Why Identifying Design Properties Matters
Recognizing design properties from a mockup is critical because:  

- **Consistency Across the App:** Defining color schemes and typography ensures every component looks unified and professional.  
- **Improved Developer-Designer Collaboration:** Developers can translate Figma designs into code more accurately when design properties are clearly defined.  
- **Stronger Brand Identity:** Colors, fonts, and styles form the visual language of the application, helping users recognize and trust the platform.  
- **Better Accessibility:** Proper use of contrast, font sizes, and text hierarchy improves readability for all users, including those with visual impairments.  
- **Faster Development:** A clear design system reduces guesswork, avoids inconsistencies, and speeds up implementation.

## UI Component Patterns

To ensure a clean, modern, and scalable frontend, the project will use a component-based architecture. Each component will be reusable, responsive, and aligned with the overall design system defined in Figma.

### 1. Navbar
- **Description:** A responsive navigation bar that provides users with quick access to core areas of the platform.  
- **Features:**  
  - Logo for brand identity.  
  - Centralized search bar for properties.  
  - User navigation (login/signup or profile dropdown).  
  - Responsive hamburger menu for mobile view.  
- **Design Approach:** Minimalist, sticky at the top, with clear call-to-action buttons.  

### 2. Property Card
- **Description:** A modular card component to display property listings in a grid layout.  
- **Features:**  
  - Property image (with hover effects for interactivity).  
  - Basic details such as location, price per night, and rating.  
  - “Favorite” button (heart icon) for saving properties.  
  - Responsive layout that adjusts from grid to stacked view on smaller screens.  
- **Design Approach:** Clean card design with soft shadows, rounded corners, and spacing to create a modern, accessible look.  

### 3. Footer
- **Description:** A structured footer that provides site information and quick navigation links.  
- **Features:**  
  - Company information and branding.  
  - Useful site links (Help, About, Careers, Contact).  
  - Social media icons for engagement.  
  - Copyright information.  
- **Design Approach:** Dark background (`#161117`), light text for contrast, organized in a multi-column grid.  

---

### Design Principles
- **Reusability:** Each component will be built as a standalone unit that can be reused across multiple pages.  
- **Responsiveness:** Designed mobile-first, with layouts that adapt seamlessly to tablets and desktops.  
- **Accessibility:** Use semantic HTML, proper ARIA roles, and high-contrast color combinations.  
- **Consistency:** All components will follow the same typography, spacing, and color palette from the design system.
